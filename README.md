# Stand-alone MUF Daemon

This is a stand-alone MUF interpreter. MUF is a language used by MUCK systems,
multiplayer networked social servers from forever ago and still used today.

It was one of the first Python programs I ever wrote, 
all previous programs of consequence having been written in MUF itself.

As such it is doubtless buggy as hell and the code is not constructed as I would have it.
It has no tests and I wouldn't expect it to work with much of anything.

Maybe some day I'll clean it up, since it seems like a fun enough toy.

I don't remember much about how this thing works, so I'm not sure how you even start the thing.
If I ever revisit this, I'll document it.
